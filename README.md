# yarhp - Yet another redesigned homepage

yarhp is a **single** page app that is designed to pull all your favorite link aggregators and information sources into one, easy to use place. It was originally built to be a quick page to load between pomodoro breaks to view the current top links of a couple sites at once.

There will never be any ads or logins.

Future improvements will likely be:
 - [ ] User configurable locations
 - [ ] User configurable intervals like switching between `week` and `today` on GitHub's trending list
 - [ ] Infinite scroll on desktop
 - [ ] Better "style"


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
